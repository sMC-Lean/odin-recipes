# odin-recipes

recipe page for Odin project;

this is designed as a practice of HTML elements and boilerplate;
it is not designed to look pretty or include any CSS etc;
I will stick to the bare minimum in the interest of moving forward quickly but still showing my work;

The goal of ths is to demonstrate the use of basic html elements as a few important attributes;
It also showed a relative path in the case of the images;

I used it to practice to the use of Git commands as well as to learn about git bash as I was previously using WSL2;
