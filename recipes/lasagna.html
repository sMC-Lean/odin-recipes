    <h3 class="heading">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large heavy based pot over medium heat. Add garlic, onion,
        celery and carrots. Cook for 10 minutes until softened and sweet. They
        should not brown (if they do, turn heat down).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add beef, turn heat up and cook the beef, breaking it up as you go.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the beef has all turned brown, add the remaining Ragu ingredients
        EXCEPT the sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir then adjust the heat so it is bubbling very gently. Place the lid
        on and cook for 1.5 to 2 hours, stirring every now and then, then remove
        the lid and simmer for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        The ragu is ready when the meat is really tender and the sauce has
        thickened and is rich. Adjust salt and pepper to taste, and add sugar if
        required
      </li>
      <li>
        Warm milk up in a saucepan (optional, just makes sauce thicken faster).
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large saucepan, melt butter over medium low heat. Add flour and mix
        constantly for 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour about 1 cup of the milk in, mixing as you go to incorporate into
        the flour mixture. Once mostly lump free, add remaining milk. Use a
        whisk if needed to make it lump free.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn heat up to medium high. Stir occasionally at first then regularly
        after a few minutes until sauce thickens, about 5 to 8 minutes. It
        should coat the back of the wooden spoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from heat, add cheese, nutmeg, salt and pepper. Mix until the
        cheese is melted. The Sauce should be thick but still easily pourable,
        the consistency of heavy cream (you need to be able to drizzle it over
        the Ragu when layering). If it’s too thick, add a splash of water or
        milk.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F.</li>
      <li>Use a 33 x 22 x 7 cm / 13 x 9 x 2.5″ baking dish.</li>
      <li>
        Smear a bit of Ragu on the base, then cover with lasagna sheets. Tear
        sheets to fit.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread over 2 1/2 cups of Ragu (enough to cover sheets), then drizzle
        over 1 cup of Cheese Sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top with lasagna sheets (Note 7). Spread with another 2 1/2 cups of
        Ragu, then 1 cup of Cheese Sauce. Top with lasagna sheets then repeat 1
        more time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top with a 4th layer of lasagna sheets, then pour over the remaining
        Cheese Sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle with Mozzarella, then bake for 25 minutes or until golden and
        bubbling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stand for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting and serving, garnished with
        basil or parsley if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
