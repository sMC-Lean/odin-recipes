    <h3>Spaghetti carbonara</h3>
    <p>
      This is a real spaghetti carbonara recipe made the traditional Italian
      way, without a single drop of cream. It relies solely on egg and cheese to
      make a luscious, creamy carbonara sauce. Food fit for a king (or queen!)
      that proves simple can be magnificent.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>175g/6 oz guanciale (pancetta or block bacon)</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 egg yolks</li>
      <li>100g/3.5 oz parmigiano reggiano</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
      <li>400g/14 oz spaghetti</li>
      <li>1 tbsp cooking/kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup pasta cooking water</li>
      <li>1 garlic clove</li>
      <li>garnish (parsley, parmigiano reggiano)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Guanciale: Cut into 0.5cm / 1/5" thick slices then into batons</li>
      <li>
        Finely grate the parmigiana reggiano or pecorino. I use a microplane
      </li>
      <li>
        Carbonara sauce:Place eggs and yolks in a large bowl. Whisk to combine.
        Then stir in the parmesan and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring 4 litres (4 quarts) of water to the boil with 1 tablespoon of
        salt. Cook the pasta per packet directions. It should be firm, not soft,
        but fully cooked through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Just before draining, scoop out one cup of pasta cooking water. Then
        drain the pasta in a colander.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook guanciale: While the pasta is cooking, place guanciale in a non
        stick pan over medium high heat. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until golden.
        No oil needed: as the guanciale heats up, the fat will melt so it fries
        in its own fat. If using garlic, add it in the last minute
      </li>
      <li>
        Tumble the hot pasta into the pan with the guanciale then toss so the
        pasta gets coated in the guanciale fat
      </li>
      <li>
        Tip the hot pasta into the bowl with the egg and use a rubber spatula to
        scrape out every drop of the guanciale fat into the bowl. That stuff is
        gold!
      </li>
      <li>Add 1/2 cup pasta cooking water into the bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Mix vigorously with the handle of a wooden spoon, spinning the pasta
        around, for around 30 seconds to 1 minute. Watch as the watery pale
        yellow liquid magically transforms into a creamy sauce. You know itâ€™s
        ready when the sauce is no longer watery and pooled in the bottom of the
        bowl. Instead, it will be thickened, creamy, and clinging to the pasta!
      </li>
      <li>Serve immediately in warm bowls. Pasta waits for no one!</li>
    </ol>
