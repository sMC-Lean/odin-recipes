    <h3 class="heading">Steps</h3>
    <h4 class="heading">Crispy Pork Belly for Banh Mi</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Dry skin overnight: Place pork belly on a plate. Pat skin dry with paper
        towels. Leave uncovered in fridge overnight to dry out the skin. (If you
        don't have time, pat the skin dry as best you can).
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 140째C/285째F (both fan and standard ovens).</li>
      <li>
        Season flesh: Drizzle flesh side with 1 tsp oil. Sprinkle over 1/2 tsp
        salt, and all the pepper and Chinese five spice. Rub all over the flesh,
        including on the sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Foil boat: Place 2 pieces of foil on a work surface. Put the belly in
        middle of foil, skin side up. Fold the sides in to enclose the belly,
        forming an open box, pinching corners to seal tightly and make it as
        snug as possible. Place meat on a tray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season skin: Pat skin dry with paper towels. Rub with 1/2 tsp oil then
        sprinkle remaining 1/2 tsp salt evenly all over the skin surface, from
        edge to edge.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slow roast 2 hours: Place in the oven and roast for 2 hours, tightening
        the foil around the pork after 1 hour (the pork will shrink). This
        protects the flesh from drying out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase heat: Remove pork from oven, then increase heat to 240째C/465째F
        (all oven types).
      </li>
      <li>
        Level pork: Remove pork from foil, discard fat and foil. Place pork on a
        rack set over a tray. Use scrunched up balls of foil stuffed under pork
        to prop it up so the skin surface is as level and horizontal as possible
        (see photos in post).
      </li>
      <li>
        30 minutes blast! Place the pork back in the oven for 30 minutes,
        rotating after 15 minutes as needed, until the crackling is deep golden,
        puffy and crispy all over. If some patches are browning faster, protect
        with foil patches.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rest 10 minutes: Remove pork from oven. Rest for 10 minutes before
        slicing.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="heading">Making the Banh Mi</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sauce: Mix the ingredients in a bowl then set aside. This will keep for
        5 days in the fridge .
      </li>
      <li>
        Chop pork: Cut the pork into 1 1/2 cm / 0.6" thick slices, then each
        slide into 1 1/2 cm / 0.6" chunks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Split & spread: Split the roll in half down the side, keeping the lid
        attached. Smear the base with 1 1/2 tbsp of pate, then 1 1/2 tbsp of
        mayonnaise (on top of the pate)
      </li>
      <li>
        Stuff: Pile about 1/3 cup pickled vegetables on the mayonnaise. Lay 2
        slices of cucumber and 2 green onions against the lid. Pile pork on top.
        Drizzle pork with 1 tbsp of sauce. Stuff coriander/cilantro down the
        side, sprinkle with chilli then2 tablespoons of crispy shallots as you
        want (if using).
      </li>
      <li>
        Serving: Eat immediately! Banh mi is definitely one of those foods best
        eaten freshly made!
